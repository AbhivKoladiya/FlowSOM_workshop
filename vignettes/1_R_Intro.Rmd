# Variables

In R, we have two types of values: numeric values and characters.
```{r}
1
"text"
```

We can save these values in variables, so we can easily access them later.
```{r}
a <- 1
a
a + a
```

# Vectors

```{r}
b <- 1:10
```

# Matrices

# Lists


# Functions


```{r}
```


# Packages

```{r}
install.packages()
library()
```
